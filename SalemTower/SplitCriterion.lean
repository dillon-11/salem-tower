# the split-case tower appearance criterion, certified
The r = 1 (completely split) half of the Dedekind grade , obtained by
composing two existing certified bricks: Mathlib's `isRoot_cyclotomic_iff` and the
Lagrange step of the master order theorem .  Statement: if a polynomial
polynomial `P` and the cyclotomic `Φ_n` share a root `x` in `ZMod q` (`q` prime,
`q ∤ n`) — the mod-q witness of `q ∣ Res(P, Φ_n)` in the split case — then
    x has multiplicative order exactly n,   and   n ∣ q − 1.
At the tower index `n = 2^(k+1)` this is the appearance criterion of the Salem
tower  in its split case: a completely split tower prime at rung
`k` is `≡ 1 (mod 2^(k+1))` — why Lehmer's tower catches the Fermat primes 257 and
65537 by splitting, while the Mersenne primes 3, 31, 127 enter through extensions
(`r > 1`, census-level pending resultants-over-extensions API).
  • `split_common_root_orderOf` — the shared root has order exactly `n`;
  • `split_common_root_dvd_sub_one` — hence `n ∣ q − 1`;
  • `tower_split_criterion` — the `n = 2^(k+1)` instantiation, with the unit
    hypothesis `P.IsRoot x` carried explicitly (the split witness of the rung).
Axiom-clean, `sorry`-free.
